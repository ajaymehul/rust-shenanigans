# Rust Shenanigans

I'm just gonna use this space to journal my rust learning journey. It's been a while since I've picked up any programming language. My work, projects, etc., have all just been javascript/python. 

Now there's this hot new programming language called Rust. Memory? I have a vague memory of it since my college C programming days. I miss memory management. I remember the discomfort of not knowing what the hell is happening behind the scenes when I learned js or python. I'm excited to get back down to low-level stuff with Rust. This shall be fun. 

## Installation

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Well that was easy!
