# Rust Shenanigans

I'm just gonna use this space to journal my rust learning journey. 
I'm going to use the offical book ([The Book]((https://doc.rust-lang.org/book))) from Rust 
It's been a while since I've picked up any programming language. My work, projects, etc., have all just been javascript/python. 

Now there's this hot new programming language called Rust. Memory? I have a vague memory of it since my college C programming days. I miss memory management. I remember the discomfort of not knowing what the hell is happening behind the scenes when I learned js or python. I'm excited to get back down to low-level stuff with Rust. This shall be fun. 

## Installation

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Well that was easy!

That's a cute crab. Terminal text art is always awesome!!

Onwards to reading the book!!!

## Chapter 2

Ah, snake casing. I don't know if I'm a fan, but okay. 

This project was fun. They haven't really explained any concepts yet. And the paradigm seems weird. But I have a feeling this `match` functionality could potentially be very powerful. We'll see. I love writing code functionally. If this ends up being so that I can write out potential paths my procedures will follow as `enums` and use `match` to call approptiate functions, that would some extremely clean code. 

I do have to note that I'm sort of sketched out by the scoping. Using `::` repeatedly might get annoying. And I'm still not clear on how the `use` brings stuff into the scope. I gotta say I'm a big fan of ES6 style imports, and importing stuff into variables. If Rust ends up implicitly bringing things into scope with `use`, maintaining code and development speed will suck.

Anyway, let's continue down this road. I have Hans Zimmer's gladiator theme playing on loop in the background and I'm feeling ambitious. Ferris, Strength & Honor!
